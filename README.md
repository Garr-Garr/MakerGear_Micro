## Building Marlin 2.0 (Version: [2.0.9.1](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases/tag/2.0.9.1))
The firmware is already compiled and ready to upload onto your Micro, but you'd like to make any upgrades or changes to the firmware you'll need to compile the firmware. To compile and upload the firmware you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Marlin (Arduino)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)
  - [Installing Marlin (VSCode)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html).
